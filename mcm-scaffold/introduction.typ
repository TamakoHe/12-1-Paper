The Earth's magnetic field is not static; it is constantly changing due to various natural and external influences. One of the major factors that affect the magnetic field is solar activity, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which interact with the Earth's magnetic field through the solar wind. These interactions can result in geomagnetic storms, which can disrupt power grids, communication systems, and navigation technologies, with potentially serious consequences for modern society.

The Earth’s magnetic field is also influenced by processes occurring within the Earth itself. The movement of the liquid iron in the outer core, as well as the complex interactions between the outer core and the mantle, play a significant role in shaping the geomagnetic field. Over time, these internal dynamics lead to changes in the strength, direction, and structure of the magnetic field, which can be observed at the Earth's surface.

To understand and monitor these variations, a network of geomagnetic observatories is required. These observatories would continuously measure changes in the Earth's magnetic field and provide crucial data for scientific research, earthquake prediction, national defense, and various technological applications. Accurate measurements of the magnetic field require sensitive sensors that can detect small variations in magnetic field strength and direction. Some data processing are needed in order to find apparent characteristic and accurate results concerning to the intensity and direction of the Earth’s magnetic field.
